CHECKIN

move config property for height to the correct places / handle this correctly

CHECKIN

Find a better way to handle large amounts of constant values. Fine tuning module needs to exist, but at the moment it is a pain to work with them and they are scattered.

Entity provider really needs to have location based lookup. Current thought: hashmap, and entities need to call

Finish fleshing out the alive entity framework and eater module: need to have tiered consumption system.

CHECKIN

Clean up the gravity stuff. Each module wants to be able to have its own gravity values.
