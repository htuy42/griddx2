root display module should not be heatmap. create root display module _/
create implementors directory for things like heatmap: forked mostly final builds that do a thing _/
test new code _/

CHECKIN

move config property for height to the correct places / handle this correctly

CHECKIN

Find a better way to handle large amounts of constant values. Fine tuning module needs to exist, but at the moment it is a pain to work with them and they are scattered.

Entity provider really needs to have location based lookup. Current thought: hashmap, and entities need to call
update location when they move. Hashmap can cache zones instead of cells potentially.

Finish fleshing out the alive entity framework and eater module: need to have tiered consumption system.

POTENTIAL FUTURE

put listeners in a kdtree for lookup by interested area

create display class and use it to manage a view + screen
allow display to modify a view on a given screen and vice versa

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

grid seems to be centered at bottom left rather than top left (and the display at top left). not clear if this is a problem
