Figure out module inheritance structure _/
repair currently extant modules _/

root display module should not be heatmap. create root display module _/
create implementors directory for things like heatmap: forked mostly final builds that do a thing _/
test new code _/

CHECKIN



POTENTIAL FUTURE

put listeners in a kdtree for lookup by interested area

create display class and use it to manage a view + screen
allow display to modify a view on a given screen and vice versa

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

grid seems to be centered at bottom left rather than top left (and the display at top left). not clear if this is a problem
